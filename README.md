## **Celest Scrap Retrieval Program**

**Objective:** Secure valuable scraps from the abandoned factory nestled within the valley on the planet Celest.

**Status:** Reports indicate scattered scraps within the abandoned factory, surrounded by a red forest and inhabited by unique fauna, including Blind Dogs and various bird species.

**Terrain Analysis:**
Celest, a planet with a distinct red forest surrounding a vast valley, presents a visually striking but hazardous environment. The designated landing spot is within the valley, providing a relatively sheltered area for operations. However, the red forest's dense foliage and the rugged terrain within the valley demand careful navigation.

**Hazards:**
- **Abandoned Factory:** The primary target for scrap retrieval is the abandoned factory, located within the valley. Other points of interest are the abandoned scientific outposts. Reports suggest the presence of unknown creatures within. The nature and severity of these creatures are uncertain, emphasizing the need for caution during operations.

**Surrounding Environment:**
- **Celestial Avifauna:** Various bird species inhabit Celest, adding an additional layer of complexity to the environment. Their behavior may range from curious observation to potential interference with the mission. Detailed observations and caution are advised during interactions.
- **Blind Dogs:** Wandering the planetary surface, Blind Dogs rely on acute hearing to navigate. Exercise extreme caution, as disturbance may provoke defensive behavior. Strategic planning is essential to avoid encounters with these creatures.

**Conclusion:**
Celest presents a hazardous yet potentially rewarding environment for scrap retrieval. The success of the mission relies on careful navigation through the red forest, strategic entry into the abandoned factory, and efficient retrieval of valuable scraps. Stay vigilant against the Blind Dogs, monitor the celestial avifauna, and exercise caution within the factory.
